# IST 707: Data Analytics
## N'Dea Jackson

## Description
During the Coronavirus off-season, the league commissioner, Adam Silver, enlisted the help of four of the world’s top data scientists to complete detailed analysis of a prior season’s player stats and provide visualizations that could be used to forecast player performance in the bubble. Outside of improving league performance, this analysis also stood to help the NBA drive their fan satisfaction ratings during the tumultuous time that is the 2019-2020. With fans and season ticket holders not being able to attend games due to the health and safety protocols surrounding the COVID19 pandemic, the league wanted to ensure that fans would be able to enjoy the same quality of playoff basketball from their homes.
