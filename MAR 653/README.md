# MAR 653: Marketing Analytics

## N'Dea Jackson

## Description
San Francisco (SFO) airport conducts extensive research on customers that come through their facilities on topics such as satisfaction levels, preferences, and demographics throughout the course of the year. By collecting this data, the airport is able to refine their practices as well as strategically team up with partners to ensure that the San Francisco airport experience remains above satisfactory. Some decisions that are often impacted by this data include transit issues, concessions, and any other key areas of concern that arise from the survey. The objective of this analysis was to identify groups of travelers that may need more encouragement before feeling safe flying and make recommendations to SFO to sway these customers
