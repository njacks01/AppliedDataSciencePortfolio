# IST 659: Database Administration Concepts and Management
## N'Dea Jackson

## Description
Jackson Memorial Hospital is located in Fort Washington, Maryland and has been operating since December of 1995. In order to provide the best medical assistance to its patients, the hospital must have an efficient system in place. Jackson Memorial Hospital is currently working on developing a hospital management system database to keep track of their patient and doctor information. The data is currently being kept in a number of ways including on multiple siloed systems operated by individual departments and on physical paper charts. The way that things are currently being operated is making it difficult to keep information consistent and also making it difficult to view all patient information at once. By implementing this database, Jackson Memorial will be able to better track and update their patient information, as well as keep track of activities and better maintain all hospital records by minimizing paperwork and siloed applications.
