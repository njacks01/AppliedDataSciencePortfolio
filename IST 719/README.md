# IST 71: Information Visualization

## N'Dea Jackson

## Description
The data set that is being used is a crime incident report that is provided by the Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset that contains records from the new crime incident report, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. The data was collected from incidents beginning June 14, 2015 and ending September 3, 2018. The hope is that with this new information, the Boston Public Police Department can gain better insight into which neighborhoods could benefit from an increased police presence. This study would also give city officials better insight into programs that they could offer in communities to curb some of the criminal activity. This data would also be made publicly available so that residents, or potential residents, of the city can get a better understanding of their surroundings.
